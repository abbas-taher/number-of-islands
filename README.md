leetcode problem #200: Number of Islands in a grid
https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/

I was not satisfied with the complexity of the solutions proposed so I have written my simple
non recursive solution that traverses the grid line by line and only checks that the item
before or above belong to an island
