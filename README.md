leetcode problem #200: Number of Islands in a grid

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/

I was not satisfied with the complexity of the solutions proposed so I have written my simple
iterative (non recursive solution) that traverses the grid line by line and item by item to checks 
that the two adjacent items (left, above) belong to an island instead of checking the 4 adjacent
items (left, after, above, below). 

The solution is quite fast and easy to understand.
